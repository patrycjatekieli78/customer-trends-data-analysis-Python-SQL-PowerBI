# Customer Behavior Analysis

**📋 Overview**

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior to uncover insights that can guide marketing, improve customer retention, and boost revenue.
The analysis combines Python, SQL, and Power BI to create a complete data pipeline from raw data to interactive visualization.


**🗂️ Dataset**

The dataset includes information on:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, subscription status)

- Purchase details (category, amount, payment type)

- Reviews and shipping preferences


**⚙️ Tools & Technologies**

 - Python (Pandas) – data loading, cleaning, and EDA

 - PostgreSQL / SQL – querying and data aggregation

 - Power BI – interactive dashboard visualization


**🔍 Project Steps**

 - Data Preparation (Python) – loaded, cleaned, and formatted the dataset using Pandas.

 - SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL) – ran analytical queries to explore customer segments, revenue trends, and purchase behavior.

 - Visualization (Power BI) – built an interactive dashboard showing key KPIs and insights.


**📊 Results & Insights**

 - Loyal customers make up the majority of the customer base (~80%)
